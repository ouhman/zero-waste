i Subject: SES Production Access Request - zerowastefrankfurt.de (Transactional Verification Emails)

  Message:

  Hello,

  I am requesting production access for Amazon SES in the eu-central-1 (Frankfurt) region for my verified domain zerowastefrankfurt.de.

  Project: Zero Waste Frankfurt - A community-driven map helping people discover sustainable shops, bulk stores, and eco-friendly businesses in Frankfurt, Germany.

  Website: https://map.zerowastefrankfurt.de

  Email Type: Transactional only (no marketing emails)

  Use Case:
  When a business owner or community member submits a new location to our map, we send a single verification email to confirm their email address. This is a standard double opt-in process to prevent spam submissions.

  Email Flow:
  1. User submits a location via our form
  2. System sends ONE verification email with a confirmation link
  3. User clicks the link to verify their submission
  4. No further emails are sent

  Expected Volume:
  - Estimated 50/100 emails per month
  - Maximum 1-2 emails per day during peak periods
  - Single email per user action (no bulk sending)

  Bounce/Complaint Handling:
  - SNS notifications configured for bounces and complaints
  - Dedicated abuse contact: ouhman@gmail.com

  Sender Address: noreply@zerowastefrankfurt.de

  This is a low-volume, legitimate transactional use case for a community project. I would appreciate production access to allow users to verify their submissions.

  Thank you for your consideration.

  Best regards,
